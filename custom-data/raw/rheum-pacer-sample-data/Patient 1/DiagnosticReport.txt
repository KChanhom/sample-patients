                "conclusion": "History: Psoriatic arthropathy. Findings: AP, oblique and lateral views of the left foot show no significant arthritic changes and no change from the prior study from 2008. Findings: AP, oblique and lateral views of the right foot show what appear to represent degenerative changes involving some of the components of the Lisfranc joint. No other significant arthritic changes are seen. There is a plantar calcaneal spur. No significant change from the prior study is seen. Findings: PA, oblique and lateral views of the left hand and wrist show nonspecific arthritic changes involving most of the interphalangeal joints. The index and ring fingers are partially flexed at the proximal interphalangeal joints with an appearance suggesting chronic deformity. The study is otherwise unremarkable. There are no arthritic changes specific for psoriatic arthritis. Findings: PA, oblique and lateral views of the right hand and wrist show nonspecific narrowing of most of the interphalangeal joints with no other arthritic changes seen. The proximal interphalangeal joints of the index and ring fingers of the right hand are also partially flexed in a chronic appearing fashion, similar to the left hand. Impression: There are no arthritic changes which are more specific for psoriatic arthritis. Most of the interphalangeal joint changes are probably those of degenerative arthritis."

Abnormal density is present in the left lung base consistent with infiltrate or other air-space disease. There is also abnormal density in the right lung base consistent with atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The bony thorax is grossly intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal density in the left lung base consistent with infiltrate versus other air-space disease. 2. Atelectasis at the right lung base.

No prior studies available for comparison. FINDINGS: Osseous structures are intact and anatomically aligned. There is mild diffuse periarticular osteopenia. There is mild irregular joint space narrowing with marginal osteophyte formation involving the 1st carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints. The remainder of the joint spaces are maintained. No definite erosions are identified. Vascular calcification is noted. No focal soft tissue swelling or calcifications are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild osteoarthritic changes of the right hand. 2. Nonspecific mild diffuse periarticular osteopenia which may be seen as an early change of rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Atherosclerotic disease."

Findings: PA, oblique and lateral views of the left hand and wrist again show absence of the greater multangular. The space between the proximal end of the metacarpal and the navicular has narrowed somewhat in the interval and there appears to be more irregularity of the proximal end of the metacarpal than on the prior study, but that could be due to projection alone. There is degenerative spurring about the joint which is unchanged. The wrist is otherwise unchanged. The hand shows nonspecific narrowing of many of the interphalangeal joints. There is also evidence of chondrocalcinosis involving the triangular cartilage at the distal end of the ulna which was present previously. Findings: PA, oblique and lateral views of the right hand and wrist show that there is narrowing of the joint between the navicular and the multangulars and the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb representing degenerative change. There is also nonspecific narrowing of a number of the interphalangeal joints. There is also calcification of the triangular cartilage. Impression: Postoperative changes of the left wrist and degenerate changes generally about both hands and wrists. There is also chondrocalcinosis involving both triangular cartilages and the possibility of CPPD should be considered."
